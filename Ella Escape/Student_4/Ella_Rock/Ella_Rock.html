        <h2>Best time to Hike Ella Rock</h2>
        <ul>
       <li> Climbing the mountain in rainy weather is dangerous. Because the way up the mountain
          is slippery during the rainy season and it is more dangerous in the dangerous hilly 
          areas.</li>
         <br>
         
          <li>Best time to climb the mountain is in the morning or evening on a rainless day.
            Because it gets very hot in the afternoon and it is difficult to climb it at such a 
            time.</li>
           <br>
           
             <li>But even late in the evening there is an ominous atmosphere. The trip along the
              Ella railway to the mountain is something that should be done in good weather. 
              When a train is approaching, move safely out of the way.</li>

          <h2>Step 1</h2>
          <p> you have set off from Ella train station and walk on the train track towards kithalella. 
            When a train comes you have to move safely out of the railway track. you will be able to 
            hear it long before arrives. After about 30-40 minutes you will see a yellow sign on the left saying 15Km/h then get 
            off the train tracks and turn left into the fields.

        <div class="boxes" id="middle">
          <h2>Step 2</h2>
          <p>Second section of the hiking is the confusing part. There will be a small bridge after 
           crossing it you will see a path that goes steeply uphill through tea bushes. Take that 
           path and go through tea bushes and tall grass lands.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="boxes" id="right">
          <h2>Step 3</h2>
          <p> The third section of the hike is more challenging physically, but the nature view will
            helps you to pass that challenge. Once you are out of the trees you will reach the top of the Ella Rock. 
            Now sit back and enjoy the views.
