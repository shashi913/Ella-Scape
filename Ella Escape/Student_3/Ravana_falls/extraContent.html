        <h2>History and Ledgend of Ravana Falls</h2>
        <p>The legend behind Ravana Falls is based on the Hindu epic, Ramayana. 
          According to the legend, Ravana, the king of Lanka, kidnapped Sita, the wife of Lord Rama, 
          and took her to his kingdom. Lord Rama, along with his army of monkeys and bears, went on a mission to rescue Sita and defeat Ravana.</p>
        <p>During the final battle between Rama and Ravana, Ravana was killed by Rama's arrows. 
          However, before he died, Ravana instructed his brother Vibhishana to perform the last rites on his body. Vibhishana, who had joined Rama's army, 
          was torn between his loyalty to his brother and his loyalty to Lord Rama.</p>
        <p>To resolve Vibhishana's dilemma, Lord Rama asked Hanuman, the monkey god, 
          to find a suitable place to perform the last rites. Hanuman flew to Sri Lanka and found several waterfalls in the area. 
          One of these waterfalls was Ravana Falls, which was located in a cave behind the waterfall. Hanuman suggested that this was the ideal place to perform the last rites, 
          as the water from the falls would wash away Ravana's sins.</p>
        <p>After Vibhishana performed the last rites at Ravana Falls, Lord Rama blessed the waterfall and said that anyone who bathed in its waters would be cleansed of their sins.
          This legend has made Ravana Falls a popular destination for both tourists and devotees.</p>
